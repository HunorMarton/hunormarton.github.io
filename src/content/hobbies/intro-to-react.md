I received a cold email from SkillShare stating that they saw my work on CodePen and asking if I’d be willing to create a course for them.

I was very bumbled, and I jumped into it as I had some idea of how to explain complex ideas in a simple way. Little did I know at the beginning that perfectionism and being an introvert are not good combinations when making a video course.

Despite spending too much time with it, I’m pleased with the result. Later, I turned from SkillShare to YouTube.
