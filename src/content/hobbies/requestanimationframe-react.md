This is my first article on CSS tricks. I wrote it around the time React Hooks came out, and I spent an unreasonable amount of time figuring out how to make requestAnimationFrame work with the new setup.

After crystallizing my thoughts, I figured this is worth sharing, and why not publish it on a more serious website? While it has nothing to do with CSS, I contacted CSS-Tricks as Chris Coyier already knew my work from CodePen. Sarah Drasner [praised](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1164535015385923584) the end result, and even Dan Abramov gave some [feedback](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1164892238494806023).
