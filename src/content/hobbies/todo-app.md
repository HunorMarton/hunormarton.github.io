Todo app based on the original version of the mobile app [Clear](https://www.useclear.com/).

It's a complex app that uses RxJS under the hood to distinguish the different user interactions from each other. The swipe left, swipe right, tap, pull down, drag and drop, and scroll events are all derived from the basic mouse events.

I wrote an article about it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/post/handling-complex-mouse-and-touch-events-with-rxjs/) and gave a talk at the [CopenhagenJS](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenjs/events/244143220/) meetup.
