My second Three.js project based on the popular [mobile game](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stack/id1080487957) by the same name. This time, I wanted to add physics.

It's also my first project for which I wrote a [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/render-3d-objects-in-browser-drawing-a-box-with-threejs/).
