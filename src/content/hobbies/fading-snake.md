The classic game with a new twist. The snake not only gets longer but also fades away if you are not quick enough. It was made with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

It came together with my first-ever [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAmYp4jKWoM).

And guess who shared it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1325442174264205312)?
