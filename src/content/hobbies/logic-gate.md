This was one of my most complex tech demos. At the time, I was really into the inner behavior of Vue.js, and I figured I could use the idea of reactivity to create a Logic gate simulator.

It not only has a fully interactive UI where you can add, remove, and attach logic gates, but it also reactively recalculates the board's output based on the input and the gate logic.
