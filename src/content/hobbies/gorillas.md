A modern remake of the iconic 1991 classic game: [Gorillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)). The game is made using plain JavaScript and the HTML Canvas element.

It was featured in the [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/674) newsletter and [CodePen Spark](https://codepen.io/spark/376).

There are several versions of this game. You can find it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/pen/jOJZqvp), [Vercel](https://gorillas-game.vercel.app/), and [Itch.io](https://hunormarton.itch.io/gorillas).

The game comes with a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5EufbUEQk) and a [freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gorillas-game-in-javascript/) that explains how it was made from the ground up. The source code can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/HunorMarton/gorillas/).
