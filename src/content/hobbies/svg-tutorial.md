This project initially started as a [CodePen challenge](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/pen/PoGbgqj) in 2020. Three years later, with updated content, I published it on its own domain at [SVG-tutorial.com](http://svg-tutorial.com).

It was featured in the [Bytes newsletter](https://bytes.dev/archives/245) and reached the top spot on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38556116) the day it was announced.
