I joined Google as a temporary staff member and participated in three projects. I worked on Scratch, internal education tooling, and a VS Code extension.

As a solo developer on the [CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home) project, I created complex React prototypes for user testing. The prototypes were a fork of the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) editor, a block-based visual programming platform for children. I developed a lessons overlay, implemented validation that checks if the steps were performed, and a hint system that highlights parts of the editor. These required digging deep into Scratch's React codebase. Through several iterations, I contributed 218 commits, constantly improving through feedback.

Later, I became part of a team, working on the frontend with Google-specific tech on interactive widgets like video and polling widgets for their internal tooling. I improved the team's snapshot testing coverage and proactively updated four Google-wide docs while learning these tools.

In Paris, I supported the development of a Visual Studio Code extension, focusing on research and experimentation.

I started the Berlin pushup group.
