I joined Google as a temporary staff member and participated in three projects. I worked on Scratch, internal education tooling, and a VS Code extension.

First, I worked on the [CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home) project to develop prototypes for UX research. CS First is a free program created by Google to teach computer science to elementary and middle school students. It uses [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) under the hood, a block-based visual programming language.

The prototypes aimed to integrate an instruction panel to Scratch that guides through a lesson. They also included modifying Scratch to highlight the features mentioned in the instruction and detect whether the students completed a task.

After the project's success, I joined a team and dived deep into Google-specific technologies. I also worked on a VS Code extension and updated some tooling documentation.

I started the Berlin pushup group.
