[Unu](https://unumotors.com/) is an electric scooter manufacturer and mobility company. I joined as a software engineer and worked on their customer-facing website and an internal web app.

I mainly worked on an internal tool that allows you to monitor scooters in the city on a map and administer certain properties.

Primarily responsible for frontend development, code reviews, and mentoring a junior backend developer. I occasionally give tech talks.
