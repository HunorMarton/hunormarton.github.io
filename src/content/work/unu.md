[Unu](https://unumotors.com/) is an electric scooter manufacturer and mobility company. As a frontend engineer, I developed a fleet management web application for scooters, building it from scratch with a teammate using Vue.js and the Ant Design Library. This tool allows you to monitor scooters in the city on a map and administer certain properties.

While mentoring a junior backend developer, I also became involved in backend development.

I simplified the development process by introducing snapshot testing.

Additionally, I contributed to the redesign of the customer-facing website.

I gave tech talks, including a proactive evaluation of switching to TypeScript, and organized a team-building event.
