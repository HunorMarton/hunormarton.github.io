description: I joined a small team as the only developer. Due to the small team and flexible setup, I also designed the appearance and behavior of many features. My responsibilities quickly evolved from a simple website to a system of multiple sites serving four different personas and a Node.js middle layer that took care of the business logic and the database.

[LEO Innovation Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leo-innovation-lab/) was a digital healthcare innovation unit established by [LEO Pharma](https://www.leo-pharma.com/). It included several independent projects.

I joined as a founding engineer of the [Studies&Me](https://studiesandme.com/) project. I created a patient-facing website for clinical trial signups and developing custom web apps for evaluating, monitoring, and scheduling patients.

I created the React frontend and a Node.js backend and used a database as a service.

In addition to development, I designed the appearance and behavior of most key features and validated them through user and A/B testing.

Automating these processes significantly streamlined patient management, replacing manual workflows.
